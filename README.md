# Github Repo for *A Tutorial for Quantifying Within- and Between-Participant Variance  in Multilevel Logistic Models*

This repo contains the R code demonstrating the concepts discussed in the tutorial, as well as example data from [Bogdanov et al., 2021](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211005465). 

- `main.R` contains the all the R code used in the main text (Code boxes, figures, etc.)
- `fx.R` contains custom code to compute ICCs on fitted models, as well as conduct bootstrapping procedure
- `compendium.pdf` synthesizes the information in `main.R` and `fx.R` into an easily readable document that can be used to reproduce the code described in the tutorial. In general, this document can be used as a "helper" to reproduce the functions and code boxes in the main tutorial, without as much of the theoretical description of the concepts. 
- `Bogdanovetal2021` contains the raw data from the DST, as found in the original [OSF repo](https://osf.io/26w4u/). 
- `README.md` is this document.
